                    It is pretty safe to say that the student is the most universally despised creature in
                    France, apart from the policeman and the priest. But the reasons for which he<sup>
                        <a href="#1.">T1</a>
                    </sup>
                    is despised are often false reasons reflecting the dominant ideology, whereas the reasons
                    for which he is justifiably despised from a revolutionary standpoint remain repressed and
                    unavowed. The partisans of false opposition are aware of these faults &#151; faults which
                    they themselves share &#151; but they invert their actual contempt into a patronizing
                    admiration. The impotent leftist intellectuals (from <em>Les Temps Modernes</em> to <em>L&#146;Express</em>)
                    go into raptures over the supposed &#147;rise of the students,&#148; and the declining
                    bureaucratic organizations (from the &#147;Communist&#148; Party to the UNEF [National Student Union]) jealously contend for his &#147;moral and material support.&#148;
                    We will show the reasons for this concern with the student and how they are rooted in the
                    dominant reality of overdeveloped capitalism. We are going to use this pamphlet to
                    denounce them one by one: the suppression of alienation necessarily follows the same path
                    as alienation. </p>

                    <p>Up till now all the analyses and studies of student life have ignored the essential.
                    None of them go beyond the viewpoint of academic specializations (psychology, sociology,
                    economics) and thus they remain fundamentally erroneous. Fourier long ago exposed this
                    &#147;methodical myopia&#148; of treating fundamental questions without relating them to
                    modern society as a whole. The fetishism of facts masks the essential category, the mass
                    of details obscures the <em>totality</em>. Everything is said about this society except
                    what it really is: a society dominated by <em>commodities</em> and <em>
                        spectacles</em>.
                    The sociologists Bourderon and Passedieu,<sup>
                        <a href="#2.">T2</a>
                        </sup> in their study <em>Les Héritiers: les
                        étudiants et la culture,</em> remain impotent in face of the few partial truths they have
                    succeeded in demonstrating. Despite their good intentions they fall back into professorial
                    morality, the inevitable Kantian ethic of a <em>real democratization through a real
                        rationalization of the teaching system</em> (i.e. of the system of teaching the system).
                    Meanwhile their disciples, such as Kravetz,<a href="#N_1_">
                        <sup>(1)</sup>
                    </a> compensate
                    for their petty-bureaucratic resentment with a hodgepodge of outdated revolutionary
                    phraseology. </p>

                    <p>Modern capitalism&#146;s spectacularization<a href="#N_2_">
                        <sup>(2)</sup>
                    </a> of
                    reification allots everyone a specific role within a general passivity. The student is no
                    exception to this rule. His is a provisional role, a rehearsal for his ultimate role as a
                    conservative element in the functioning of the commodity system. Being a student is a form
                    of initiation. </p>

                    <p>This initiation magically recapitulates all the characteristics of mythical initiation.
                    It remains totally cut off from historical, individual and social reality. The student
                    leads a double life, poised between his present status and the utterly separate future
                    status into which he will one day be abruptly thrust. Meanwhile his schizophrenic
                    consciousness enables him to withdraw into his &#147;initiation group,&#148; forget about
                    his future, and bask in the mystical trance of a present sheltered from history. It is not
                    surprising that he avoids facing his situation, particularly its economic aspects: in our
                    &#147;affluent society&#148; he is still a pauper. More than 80% of students come from
                    income groups above the working class, yet 90% of them have less money than the lowest
                    worker. Student poverty is an anachronism in the society of the spectacle: it has yet to
                    attain the new poverty of the new proletariat. In a period when more and more young people
                    are breaking free from moral prejudices and family authority as they are subjected to
                    blunt, undisguised exploitation at the earliest age, the student clings to his tame and
                    irresponsible &#147;protracted infancy.&#148; Belated adolescent crises may provoke
                    occasional arguments with his family, but he uncomplainingly accepts being treated as a
                    baby by the various institutions that govern his daily life. (If they ever stop shitting
                    in his face, it&#146;s only to come around and bugger him.) </p>

                    <p>Student poverty is merely the most gross expression of the colonization of all domains
                    of social practice. The projection of social guilty conscience onto the students masks the
                    poverty and servitude of everyone. </p>

                    <p>But our contempt for the student is based on quite different reasons. He is
                    contemptible not only for his actual poverty, but also for his complacency regarding every
                    kind of poverty, his unhealthy propensity to wallow in his own alienation in the hope,
                    amid the general lack of interest, of arousing interest in his particular lacks. The
                    requirements of modern capitalism determine that most students will become mere <em>low-level
                        functionaries,</em> serving functions comparable to those of skilled workers in the
                    nineteenth century.<a href="#N_3_">
                        <sup>(3)</sup>
                    </a> Faced with the prospect of such a
                    dismal and mediocre &#147;reward&#148; for his shameful current poverty, the student
                    prefers to take refuge in an unreally lived present, which he decorates with an illusory
                    glamor.</p>

                    <p>The student is a stoical slave: the more chains authority binds him with, the freer he
                    thinks he is. Like his new family, the university, he sees himself as the most
                    &#147;independent&#148; social being, whereas he is in fact <em>directly subjected</em> to
                    the two most powerful systems of social authority: the family and the state. As their
                    well-behaved, grateful and <em>submissive child,</em> he shares and embodies all the
                    values and mystifications of the system. The illusions that formerly had to be imposed on
                    white-collar workers are now willingly internalized and transmitted by the mass of future
                    petty functionaries. </p>

                    <p>If ancient social poverty produced the most grandiose systems of compensation in
                    history (religions), the student, in his marginal poverty, can find no other consolation
                    than the most shopworn images of the ruling society, the farcical repetition of all its
                    alienated products. </p>

                    <p>As an ideological being, the French student always <em>arrives too late</em>. 
                    The
                    values and enthusiasms that are the pride of his closed little world have all long ago been
                    condemned by history as laughable and untenable illusions. </p>

                    <p>Once upon a time the universities had a certain prestige; the student persists in the
                    belief that he is lucky to be there. But he came too late. His mechanical, specialized
                    education is as profoundly degraded (in comparison to the former level of general
                    bourgeois culture)<a href="#N_4_">
                        <sup>(4)</sup>
                    </a> as his own intellectual level,
                    because the modern economic system requires a mass production of uneducated students who
                    have been rendered incapable of thinking. The university has become an institutional
                    organization of ignorance. &#147;High culture&#148; is being degraded in the assembly-line
                    production of professors, <em>all</em> of whom are cretins and most of whom would be
                    jeered by any audience of highschoolers. But the student, in his
                    mental menopause, is unaware of all this; he continues to listen respectfully to his
                    masters, conscientiously suppressing all critical spirit so as to immerse himself in the
                    mystical illusion of being a &#147;student&#148; &#151; someone seriously devoted to
                    learning <em>serious things</em> &#151; in the hope that his professors will ultimately
                    impart to him the ultimate truths of the world. The future revolutionary society will
                    condemn all the noise of the lecture halls and classrooms as nothing but <em>
                        verbal pollution</em>. The student is already a very bad joke. </p>

                    <p>The student is unaware that history is altering even his little &#147;ivory tower&#148;
                    world. The famous &#147;crisis of the university,&#148; that detail of a more general
                    crisis of modern capitalism, remains the object of a deaf-mute dialogue among various
                    specialists. It simply expresses the difficulties of this particular sector of production
                    in its belated adjustment to the general transformation of the productive apparatus. The
                    remnants of the old liberal bourgeois university ideology are becoming banalized as its
                    social basis is disappearing. During the era of free-trade capitalism, when the liberal
                    state left the university a certain marginal freedom, the latter could imagine itself as
                    an independent power. But even then it was intimately bound to the needs of that type of
                    society, providing the privileged minority with an adequate general education before they
                    took up their positions within the ruling class. The pathetic bitterness of so many
                    nostalgic professors<a href="#N_5_">
                        <sup>(5)</sup>
                    </a> stems from the fact that they have
                    lost their former role as guard-dogs serving the future masters and have been reassigned
                    to the considerably less noble function of sheep-dogs in charge of herding white-collar
                    flocks to their respective factories and offices in accordance with the needs of the
                    planned economy. These professors hold up their archaisms as an alternative to the
                    technocratization of the university and imperturbably continue to purvey scraps of
                    &#147;general&#148; culture to audiences of future specialists who will not know how to
                    make any use of them. </p>

                    <p>More serious, and thus more dangerous, are the modernists of the Left and those of the
                    UNEF led by the FGEL &#147;extremists,&#148; who demand a &#147;reform of the university
                    structure&#148; so as to &#147;reintegrate the university into social and economic
                    life,&#148; i.e. so as to adapt it to the needs of modern capitalism. The colleges that
                    once supplied &#147;general culture&#148; to the ruling class, though still retaining some
                    of their anachronistic prestige, are being transformed into force-feeding factories for
                    rearing lower and middle functionaries. Far from contesting this historical process, which
                    is subordinating one of the last relatively autonomous sectors of social life to the
                    demands of the commodity system, the above-mentioned progressives protest against delays
                    and inefficiencies in its implementation. They are the partisans of the future
                    cybernetized university, which is already showing its ugly head here and there.<a href="#N_6_">
                        <sup>(6)</sup>
                    </a> The commodity system and its modern servants &#151; these
                    are the enemy. </p>

                    <p>But all these struggles take place over the head of the student, somewhere in the
                    heavenly realm of his masters. His own life is totally out of his control &#151; <em>life
                        itself</em> is totally beyond him. </p>

                    <p>Because of his acute economic poverty the student is condemned to a paltry form of <em>
                        survival</em>.
                    But, always self-satisfied, he parades his very ordinary indigence as if it were an
                    original &#147;lifestyle,&#148; making a virtue of his shabbiness and pretending to be a
                    bohemian. &#147;Bohemianism&#148; is far from an original solution in any case, but the
                    notion that one could live a really bohemian life without a complete and definitive break
                    with the university milieu is ludicrous. But the student bohemian (and every student likes
                    to pretend that he is a bohemian at heart) clings to his imitative and degraded version of
                    what is, in the best of cases, only a mediocre individual solution. Even elderly
                    provincial ladies know more about life than he does. Thirty years after Wilhelm Reich (that
                    excellent educator of youth),<a href="#N_7_">
                        <sup>(7)</sup>
                    </a>&nbsp;our would-be
                    &#147;nonconformist&#148; continues to follow the most traditional forms of amorous-erotic
                    behavior, reproducing the general relations of class society in his intersexual relations.
                    His susceptibility to recruitment as a militant for any cause is an ample demonstration of
                    his real impotence. </p>

                    <p>In spite of his more or less loose use of time within the margin of individual liberty
                    allowed by the totalitarian spectacle, the student avoids adventure and experiment,
                    preferring the security of the straitjacketed daily space-time organized for his benefit
                    by the guardians of the system. Though not constrained to separate his work and leisure,
                    he does so of his own accord, all the while hypocritically proclaiming his contempt for
                    &#147;good students&#148; and &#147;study fiends.&#148; He accepts every type of
                    separation and then bemoans the &#147;lack of communication&#148; in his religious,
                    sports, political or union club. He is so stupid and so miserable that he voluntarily

                    psycho-police control established by the vanguard of modern oppression and naturally
                    hailed as a great victory for student unionism.<a href="#N_8_">

                    <p>But the real poverty of the student&#146;s everyday life finds its immediate fantasy-compensation in the opium of cultural commodities. In the cultural spectacle the student
                    finds his natural place as a respectful disciple. Although he is close to the production
                    point, access to the real Sanctuary of Culture is denied him; so he discovers &#147;modern
                    culture&#148; as an <em>admiring spectator</em>. In an era when <em>art is dead</em> he
                    remains the most loyal patron of the theaters and film clubs and the most avid consumer of
                    the packaged fragments of its preserved corpse displayed in the cultural supermarkets.
                    Consuming unreservedly and uncritically, he is in his element. If the &#147;Culture
                    Centers&#148; didn&#146;t exist, the student would have invented them. He is a perfect
                    example of all the platitudes of American market research: a conspicuous consumer,
                    conditioned by advertising into fervently divergent attitudes toward products that are
                    identical in their nullity, with an irrational preference for Brand X (Pérec or Godard,
                    for example) and an irrational prejudice against Brand Y (Robbe-Grillet or Lelouch,
                    perhaps). </p>

                    <p>And when the &#147;gods&#148; who produce and organize his cultural spectacle take
                    human form on the stage, he is their main audience, their perfect spectator. Students turn
                    out <em>en masse</em> to their most obscene exhibitions. When the priests of different
                    churches present their lame, consequenceless dialogues (seminars of &#147;Marxist&#148;
                    thought, conferences of Catholic intellectuals) or when the literary debris come together
                    to bear witness to their impotence (five thousand students attending a forum on &#147;What
                    are the possibilities of literature?&#148;), who but students fill the halls? </p>

                    <p>Incapable of real passions, the student seeks titillation in the passionless polemics
                    between the celebrities of Unintelligence: Althusser &#151; Garaudy &#151; Sartre &#151;

                    the market can produce its ersatz version of long outmoded (though once important)
                    ventures; in his ignorance he takes every rehash for a cultural revolution. His overriding
                    concern is always to maintain his cultural status. Like everyone else, he takes pride in
                    buying the paperback reprints of important and difficult texts that &#147;mass
                    culture&#148; is disseminating at an accelerating pace.<a href="#N_10_">

                    Since he doesn&#146;t know how to read, he contents himself with fondly gazing at them. </p>

                    <p>His favorite reading matter is the press that specializes in promoting the frenzied
                    consumption of cultural novelties; he unquestioningly accepts its pronouncements as
                    guidelines for his tastes. He revels in <em>L&#146;Express</em> or <em>Le Nouvel
                        Observateur;</em> or perhaps he prefers <em>Le Monde,</em> which he feels is an accurate
                    and truly &#147;objective&#148; newspaper, though he finds its style somewhat too
                    difficult. To deepen his general knowledge he dips into <em>Planète,</em> the slick
                    magical magazine that removes the wrinkles and blackheads from old ideas. With such guides
                    he hopes to gain an understanding of the modern world and become politically conscious! </p>

                    <p>For in France, more than anywhere else, the student is content to be <em>
                        politicized</em>.
                    But his political participation is mediated by the same <em>spectacle</em>. Thus he seizes
                    upon all the pitiful tattered remnants of a Left that was annihilated <em>more than forty
                        years ago </em>by &#147;socialist&#148; reformism and Stalinist counterrevolution. The
                    rulers are well aware of this defeat of the workers movement, and so are the workers
                    themselves, though more confusedly. But the student remains oblivious of it, and continues
                    to participate blithely in the most laughable demonstrations that never draw anybody but
                    students. This utter political ignorance makes the universities a happy hunting ground for
                    the manipulators of the dying bureaucratic organizations (from the &#147;Communist&#148;
                    Party to the UNEF), which totalitarianly program the student&#146;s political options.
                    Occasionally there are deviationary tendencies and slight impulses toward
                    &#147;independence,&#148; but after a period of token resistance the dissidents are
                    invariably reincorporated into an order they have never fundamentally questioned.<a href="#N_11_">
                        <sup>(11)</sup>
                    </a> The &#147;Revolutionary Communist Youth,&#148; whose
                    title is a case of ideological falsification gone mad (they are neither revolutionary nor
                    communist nor young), pride themselves on having rebelled against the Communist Party,
                    then join the Pope in appealing for &#147;Peace in Vietnam.&#148; </p>

                    <p>The student takes pride in his opposition to the &#147;outdated&#148; aspects of the de
                    Gaulle regime, but in so doing he unwittingly implies his approval of <em>older crimes</em>
                    (such as those of Stalinism in the era of Togliatti, Garaudy, Khrushchev and Mao). His
                    &#147;youthful&#148; attitudes are thus actually even more <em>old-fashioned</em> than the
                    regime&#146;s &#151; the Gaullists at least understand modern society well enough to
                    administer it. </p>

                    <p>But this is not the student&#146;s only archaism. He feels obliged to have general
                    ideas on everything, to form a coherent worldview capable of giving meaning to his need
                    for nervous activity and asexual promiscuity. As a result he falls prey to the last
                    doddering missionary efforts of the churches. With atavistic ardor he rushes to adore the
                    putrescent carcass of God and to cherish the decomposing remains of prehistoric religions
                    in the belief that they enrich him and his time. Along with elderly provincial ladies,
                    students form the social category with the highest percentage of admitted religious
                    adherents. Everywhere else priests have been insulted and driven off, but university
                    clerics openly continue to bugger thousands of students in their spiritual shithouses. </p>

                    <p>In all fairness, we should mention that there are <em>some</em> tolerably intelligent
                    students. These latter easily get around the miserable regulations designed to control the
                    more mediocre students. They are able to do so precisely because they have <em>understood
                        the system;</em> and they understand it because they despise it and know themselves to be
                    its enemies. They are in the educational system in order to get the best it has to offer:
                    namely, grants. Taking advantage of the contradiction that, for the moment at least,
                    obliges the system to maintain a small, relatively independent sector of academic
                    &#147;research,&#148; they are going to calmly carry the germs of sedition to the highest
                    level. Their open contempt for the system goes hand in hand with the lucidity that enables
                    them to outdo the system&#146;s own lackeys, especially intellectually. They are already
                    among the theorists of the coming revolutionary movement, and take pride in beginning to
                    be feared as such. They make no secret of the fact that what they extract so easily from
                    the &#147;academic system&#148; is used for its destruction. For the student cannot revolt
                    against anything without revolting against his <em>studies,</em> though the necessity of
                    this revolt is felt less naturally by him than by the worker, who spontaneously revolts
                    against his condition as worker. But the student is a product of modern society just like
                    Godard and Coca-Cola. His extreme alienation can be contested only through a contestation
                    of the entire society. This critique can in no way be carried out on the student terrain:
                    the student who defines himself as such identifies himself with a pseudovalue that
                    prevents him from becoming aware of his real dispossession, and he thus remains at the
                    height of false consciousness. But everywhere where modern society is beginning to be
                    contested, young people are taking part in that contestation; and this revolt represents
                    the most direct and thorough critique of student behavior. </p>

                    After a long period of slumber and permanent counterrevolution, the last few years have
                    seen the first gestures of a new period of contestation, most visibly among young people.
                    But the society of the spectacle, in its representation of itself and its enemies, imposes
                    its own ideological categories on the world and its history. It reassuringly presents
                    everything that happens as if it were part of the natural order of things, and reduces
                    truly new developments that herald its <em>supersession</em> to the level of superficial
                    consumer novelties. In reality the revolt of young people against the way of life imposed
                    on them is simply a harbinger, a preliminary expression of a far more widespread
                    subversion that will embrace all those who are feeling the increasing impossibility of <em>living</em>
                    in this society, a prelude to the next revolutionary era. With their usual methods of
                    inverting reality, the dominant ideology and its daily mouthpieces reduce this real
                    historical movement to a socio-natural category: the Idea of Youth. Any new youth revolt
                    is presented as merely the eternal revolt of youth that recurs with each generation, only
                    to fade away &#147;when young people become engaged in the serious business of production
                    and are given real, concrete aims.&#148; The &#147;youth revolt&#148; has been subjected
                    to a veritable journalistic inflation (people are presented with the spectacle of a revolt
                    to distract them from the possibility of participating in one). It is presented as an
                    aberrant but necessary social safety valve that has its part to play in the smooth
                    functioning of the system. This revolt against the society reassures the society because
                    it supposedly remains partial, pigeonholed in the <em>apartheid</em> of &#147;adolescent
                    problems&#148; (analogous to &#147;racial issues&#148; or &#147;women&#146;s
                    concerns&#148;), and is soon outgrown. In reality, if there is a &#147;youth problem&#148;
                    in modern society, it simply consists in the fact that young people feel the profound
                    crisis of this society most acutely &#151; and try to express it. The young generation is
                    a product par excellence of modern society, whether it chooses integration into it or the
                    most radical rejection of it. What is surprising is not that youth is in revolt, but that
                    &#147;adults&#148; are so resigned. But the reason for this is historical, not biological:
                    the previous generation lived through all the defeats and swallowed all the lies of the
                    long, shameful disintegration of the revolutionary movement. </p>

                    <p>In itself, &#147;Youth&#148; is a publicity myth linked to the capitalist mode of
                    production, as an expression of its dynamism. This illusory preeminence of youth became
                    possible with the economic recovery after World War II, following the mass entry into the
                    market of a whole new category of more pliable consumers whose consumer <em>role</em>
                    enabled them to identify with the society of the spectacle. But the official ideology is
                    once again finding itself in contradiction with socioeconomic reality (lagging behind it),
                    and it is precisely the youth who have first asserted an irresistible rage to live and who
                    are spontaneously revolting against the daily boredom and dead time that the old world
                    continues to produce in spite of all its modernizations. The most rebellious among them
                    are expressing a pure, nihilistic rejection of this society without any awareness of the
                    possibility of superseding it. But such a perspective is being sought and developed
                    everywhere in the world. It must attain the coherence of theoretical critique and the
                    practical organization of this coherence. </p>

                    <p>At the most primitive level, the &#147;delinquents&#148; all over the world express
                    with the most obvious violence their refusal to be integrated into the society. But the
                    abstractness of their refusal gives them no chance to escape the contradictions of a
                    system of which they are a spontaneous negative product. The delinquents are produced by
                    every aspect of the present social order: the urbanism of the housing projects, the
                    breakdown of values, the extension of an increasingly boring consumer leisure, the growing
                    police-humanist control over every aspect of daily life, and the economic survival of a
                    family unit that has lost all significance. They despise work, but they accept
                    commodities. They want everything the spectacle offers them and they want it now, but
                    they can&#146;t afford to pay for it. This fundamental contradiction dominates their
                    entire existence, constricting their efforts to make a truly free use of their time, to
                    express themselves, and to form a sort of community. (Their microcommunities recreate a
                    primitivism on the margin of developed society, and the poverty of this primitivism
                    inevitably recreates a hierarchy within the gang. This hierarchy, which can fulfill itself
                    only in wars with other gangs, <em>isolates</em> each gang and each individual within the
                    gang.) In order to escape this contradiction the delinquent must either resign himself to
                    going to work in order to buy the commodities &#151; to this end a whole sector of
                    production is  specifically devoted to seducing him into consumerhood (motorcycles,
                    electric guitars, clothes, records, etc.) &#151; or else he is forced to attack the laws
                    of the commodity, either in a rudimentary manner, by stealing, or in a conscious manner
                    by advancing toward a revolutionary critique of the world of the commodity. Consumption
                    &#147;mellows out&#148; the behavior of these young rebels and their revolt subsides into
                    the worst conformism. For the delinquents only two futures are possible: the awakening of
                    revolutionary consciousness or blind obedience in the factories. </p>

                    <p>The <em>Provos</em> are the first supersession of the experience of the delinquents,
                    the organization of its first political expression. They arose out of an encounter between
                    a few dregs from the world of decomposed art in search of a career and a mass of young
                    rebels in search of self-expression. Their organization enabled both sides to advance
                    toward and achieve a new type of contestation. The &#147;artists&#148; contributed a few
                    ideas about play, though still quite mystified and decked out in a patchwork of
                    ideological garments; the young rebels had nothing to offer but the violence of their
                    revolt. From the beginning the two tendencies have remained distinct; the theoryless
                    masses have found themselves under the tutelage of a small clique of dubious leaders who
                    have tried to maintain their &#147;power&#148; by concocting a &#147;provotarian&#148;
                    ideology. Their neoartistic reformism has prevailed over the possibility that the
                    delinquents&#146; violence might extend itself to the plane of ideas in an attempt to
                    supersede art. The Provos are an expression of the last reformism produced by modern
                    capitalism: the reform of everyday life. Although nothing short of an uninterrupted
                    revolution will be able to change life, the Provo hierarchy &#151; like Bernstein with his
                    vision of gradually transforming capitalism into socialism by means of reforms &#151;
                    believes that a few improvements can transform everyday life. By opting for the
                    fragmentary, the Provos end up accepting the totality. To give themselves a base, their
                    leaders have concocted the ridiculous ideology of the &#147;provotariat&#148; (an
                    artistico-political salad composed of mildewed leftovers of a feast they
                    have never known). This new provotariat is contrasted with the supposedly passive and
                    &#147;bourgeoisified&#148; proletariat (eternal refrain of all the cretins of the
                    century). Because they despair of a total change, the Provos despair of the only force
                    capable of bringing about that change. The proletariat is the motor of capitalist society,
                    and thus its mortal threat: everything is designed to repress it &#151; parties,
                    bureaucratic unions, police (who attack it more often than they do the Provos), and the
                    colonization of its entire life &#151; because it is the only really menacing force. The
                    Provos have understood none of this; they remain incapable of criticizing the production
                    system and thus remain prisoners of the system as a whole. When an antiunion workers&#146;
                    riot inspired the Provo base to join in with the direct violence, their bewildered leaders
                    were left completely behind and could find nothing better to do than denounce
                    &#147;excesses&#148; and appeal for nonviolence. These leaders, whose program had
                    advocated provoking the authorities so as to reveal their repressiveness, ended up by
                    complaining that they had been provoked by the police. And they appealed over the radio to
                    the young rioters to let themselves be guided by the &#147;Provos,&#148; i.e. by the
                    leaders, who have amply demonstrated that their vague &#147;anarchism&#148; is nothing but
                    one more lie. To arrive at a revolutionary critique, the rebellious Provo base has to
                    begin by revolting against its own leaders, which means linking up with the objective
                    revolutionary forces of the proletariat and dumping people like Constant and De Vries (the
                    one the official artist of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the other a failed
                    parliamentary candidate who admires the English police). Only in this way can the Provos
                    link up with the authentic modern contestation of which they are already one of the
                    fledgling expressions. If they really want to change the world, they have no use for those
                    who are content to paint it white.<sup>

                    <p>By revolting against their studies, the American students have directly called in
                    question a society that needs such studies. And their revolt (in Berkeley<sup>
                        <a href="#4.">T5</a>
                    </sup> and elsewhere)
                    against the university hierarchy has from the start asserted itself as <em>a 
                        revolt against the whole social system based on hierarchy and on the 
                        dictatorship of the economy and the state</em>. By refusing to accept the business and institutional roles for which
                    their specialized studies have been designed to prepare them, they are profoundly calling
                    in question a system of production that alienates all activity and its products from their
                    producers. For all their groping and confusion, the rebelling American youth are already
                    seeking a coherent revolutionary alternative from within the &#147;affluent society.&#148;
                    Unfortunately, they remain largely fixated on two relatively incidental aspects of the
                    American crisis &#151; the blacks and Vietnam &#151; and the small &#147;New Left&#148;
                    organizations suffer from this fact. Their forms reflect a striving for genuine democracy,
                    but the weakness of their subversive content causes them to fall into dangerous
                    contradictions. Due to their extreme political ignorance and naïve illusions about what
                    is really going on in the world, their hostility to the traditional politics of the old
                    left organizations is easily rechanneled into unwitting acceptance of them. <em>Abstract</em>
                    opposition to their society leads them to admire or support its most conspicuous enemies:
                    the &#147;socialist&#148; bureaucracies of China or Cuba. A group like the
                    &#147;Resurgence Youth Movement&#148; can in the same breath condemn the state and praise
                    the &#147;Cultural Revolution,&#148; that pseudorevolt staged by the most gargantuan
                    bureaucracy of modern times: Mao&#146;s China. At the same time, these semilibertarian and
                    nondirective organizations, due to their glaring lack of content, are constantly in danger
                    of slipping into the ideology of &#147;group dynamics&#148; or into the closed world of
                    the sect. The widespread consumption of drugs is an expression of real poverty and a
                    protest against this real poverty: it is a fallacious search for freedom in a world
                    without freedom, a religious critique of a world that has already superseded religion. It
                    is no accident that it is so prevalent in the Beat milieu (that right wing of the youth
                    revolt), where ideological refusal coexists with acceptance of the most ridiculous
                    superstitions (Zen, spiritualism, &#147;New Church&#148; mysticism, and other rotten
                    carcasses such as Gandhiism and Humanism). In their search for a revolutionary program the
                    American students make the same mistake as the Provos and proclaim themselves &#147;the
                    most exploited class in society&#148;; they must henceforth understand that they have no
                    interests distinct from all those who are subject to commodity slavery and generalized
                    oppression. </p>

                    <p>In the Eastern bloc, bureaucratic totalitarianism is also beginning to produce its own
                    forces of negation. The youth revolt there is particularly intense, but the only
                    information on it must be derived from the denunciations of it in official publications
                    and from the police measures undertaken to contain it. From these sources we learn that a
                    segment of the youth no longer &#147;respects&#148; moral and family order (which still
                    exists there in its most detestable bourgeois form), devotes itself to
                    &#147;debauchery,&#148; despises work, and no longer obeys the Party police. The USSR has
                    set up a special ministry for the express purpose of combatting this new delinquency.
                    Alongside this diffuse revolt, a more coherently formulated contestation is striving to
                    express itself; groups and clandestine journals emerge and disappear depending on the
                    fluctuations of police repression. So far the most important act has been the publication
                    of the <em>Open Letter to the Polish Communist Party</em> by the young Poles <em>Kuron</em>
                    and <em>Modzelewski,</em>

                    accomplish this, &#147;revolution is inevitable.&#148; The Eastern intelligentsia is
                    seeking to elucidate and make conscious the critique that the workers have already
                    concretized in East Berlin, Warsaw and Budapest<sup>

                    </sup>: the proletarian critique of bureaucratic
                    class power. This revolt is in the difficult situation of having to pose and solve real
                    problems at one fell swoop. In other countries struggle is possible but the goal remains
                    mystified. In the Eastern bureaucracies the struggle is without illusions and the goals
                    are known; the problem is to devise the forms that can open the way to their realization. </p>

                    <p>In England the youth revolt found its first organized expression in the antibomb
                    movement. This partial struggle, rallied around the vague program of the <em>Committee of
                        100</em> &#151; which was capable of bringing 300,000 demonstrators into the streets
                    &#151; accomplished its most beautiful action in spring 1963 with the &#147;Spies for

                    been able to hold out against the assault of the modern world; the accelerating
                    decomposition of secular values is engendering profoundly revolutionary tendencies in the

                    The struggles of the British youth must link up with those of the British working class,
                    which with its shop steward movement and wildcat strikes remains one of the most combative
                    in the world. The victory of these two struggles is only possible if they work out common
                    perspectives. The collapse of the Labour government is an additional factor that could be
                    conducive to such an alliance. Their encounter will touch off explosions compared to which
                    the Amsterdam Provo riot will be seen as child&#146;s play. Only in this way can a real
                    revolutionary movement arise that will answer practical needs. </p>

                    <p>Japan is the only advanced industrialized country where this fusion of student youth
                    and radical workers has already taken place. </p>

                    <p>The <em>Zengakuren,</em> the well-known organization of revolutionary students, and the
                    <em>League of Young Marxist Workers</em> are the two major organizations formed on the
                    common orientation of the <em>Revolutionary Communist League</em>. This formation is
                    already tackling the problems of revolutionary organization. Simultaneously and without
                    illusions it combats both Western capitalism and the bureaucracy of the so-called
                    socialist countries. It already groups together several thousand students and workers
                    organized on a democratic and antihierarchical basis, with all members participating in
                    all the activities of the organization. These Japanese revolutionaries are the first in
                    the world to carry on large organized struggles in the name of an advanced revolutionary
                    program and with a substantial mass participation. In demonstration after demonstration
                    thousands of workers and students have poured into the streets to wage violent struggle
                    with the Japanese police. However, the RCL lacks a complete and concrete analysis of the
                    two systems it fights with such ferocity. It has yet to define the precise nature of
                    bureaucratic exploitation, just as it has yet to explicitly formulate the characteristics
                    of modern capitalism, the critique of everyday life and the critique of the spectacle. The
                    Revolutionary Communist League is still fundamentally a vanguard political organization,
                    an heir of the best features of the classical proletarian organizations. It is presently
                    the most important revolutionary grouping in the world, and should henceforth be a pole of
                    discussion and a rallying point for the new global revolutionary proletarian critique.<sup>

                    as its object and as its objective. This critique must be brought to bear on the
                    world&#146;s actual past, on its present reality, and on the prospects for transforming
                    it. We cannot grasp the whole truth of the present world, much less formulate the project
                    of its total subversion, unless we are capable of <em>revealing its hidden history,</em>
                    unless we subject the entire history of the international revolutionary movement,
                    initiated over a century ago by the Western proletariat, to a demystified critical
                    scrutiny. &#147;This movement against the whole organization of the old world came to an
                    end long ago&#148; (<em>Internationale Situationniste</em> #7). <em>It</em> <em>
                        failed</em>.
                    Its last historical manifestation was the Spanish proletarian revolution, defeated in
                    Barcelona in May 1937. But its official &#147;failures&#148; and &#147;victories&#148;
                    must be judged in the light of their eventual consequences, and their essential truths
                    must be brought back to light. In this regard we can agree with Karl Liebknecht&#146;s
                    remark, on the eve of his assassination,<sup>
                        <a href="#9.">T9</a>
                    </sup> that &#147;some defeats are really victories,
                    while some victories are more shameful than any defeat.&#148; Thus
                    the first great &#147;defeat&#148; of proletarian power, the Paris Commune, was in reality
                    its first great <em>victory,</em> in that for the first time the early proletariat
                    demonstrated its historical capacity to organize all aspects of social life <em>
                        freely</em>.
                    Whereas its first great &#147;victory,&#148; the Bolshevik revolution, ultimately turned
                    out to be its most disastrous defeat. </p>

                    <p>The triumph of the Bolshevik order coincided with the international
                    counterrevolutionary movement that began with the crushing of the Spartakists by German
                    &#147;Social Democracy.&#148; The commonality of the jointly victorious Bolshevism and
                    reformism went deeper than their apparent antagonism, for the Bolshevik order also turned
                    out to be merely a new variation on the old theme, a new guise of the old order. The
                    results of the Russian counterrevolution were, internally, the establishment and
                    development of a new mode of exploitation, <em>bureaucratic state capitalism,</em> and
                    externally, the spread of a &#147;Communist&#148; International whose branches served the
                    sole purpose of defending and reproducing their Russian model. Capitalism, in its
                    bureaucratic and bourgeois variants, won a new lease on life, over the dead bodies of the
                    sailors of Kronstadt, the peasants of the Ukraine, and the workers of Berlin, Kiel, Turin,
                    Shanghai, and finally Barcelona. </p>

                    <p>The Third International, ostensibly created by the Bolsheviks to counteract the
                    degenerate social-democratic reformism of the Second International and to unite the
                    vanguard of the proletariat in &#147;revolutionary communist parties,&#148; was too
                    closely linked to the interests of its founders to ever bring about a <em>genuine
                        socialist revolution</em> anywhere. In reality the Third International was essentially a
                    continuation of the Second. The Russian model was rapidly imposed on the Western
                    workers&#146; organizations and their evolutions were thenceforth one and the same. The
                    totalitarian dictatorship of the bureaucracy, the new ruling class, over the Russian
                    proletariat found its echo in the subjection of the great mass of workers in other
                    countries to a stratum of political and labor-union bureaucrats whose interests had become
                    clearly contradictory to those of their rank-and-file constituents. While the Stalinist
                    monster haunted working-class consciousness, capitalism was becoming bureaucratized and
                    overdeveloped, resolving its internal crises and proudly proclaiming this new victory to
                    be permanent. In spite of apparent variations and oppositions, a single social form
                    dominates the world. The principles of the <em>old world</em> continue to govern our <em>modern
                        world;</em> the tradition of dead generations still weighs on the minds of the living. </p>

                    <p>Opposition to this world offered from within it, on its own terrain, by supposedly
                    revolutionary organizations is only an apparent opposition. Such pseudo-opposition,
                    propagating the worst mystifications and invoking more or less rigid <em>ideologies,</em>
                    ultimately helps consolidate the dominant order. The labor unions and political parties
                    forged by the working class as tools for its own emancipation have become mere safety
                    valves, regulating mechanisms of the system, the private property of leaders seeking their
                    own particular emancipation by using them as stepping stones to roles within the ruling
                    class of a society they never dream of calling into question. The party program or union
                    statute may contain vestiges of &#147;revolutionary&#148; phraseology, but their practice
                    is everywhere <em>reformist</em>. (Their reformism, moreover, has become virtually
                    meaningless since capitalism itself has become officially reformist.) Wherever the parties
                    have been able to seize power &#151; in countries more backward than 1917 Russia &#151;
                    they have only reproduced the Stalinist model of totalitarian counterrevolution.<a href="#N_14_">

                    bureaucratized capitalism, the token opposition indispensable for maintaining 
                    its police-humanism. Vis-à-vis the worker masses, they remain the unfailing and 
                    unconditional defenders of the bureaucratic counterrevolution and the obedient 
                    agents of its foreign policy. Constantly working to perpetuate the universal 
                    dictatorship of the economy and the state, they are the bearers of the biggest 
                    lie in a world of lies. As the situationists put it, “A universally dominant 
                    social system, tending toward totalitarian self-regulation, is only apparently 
                    being combatted by false forms of opposition — illusory forms that remain trapped 
                    on the system’s own terrain and thus only serve to reinforce it. Bureaucratic 
                    pseudosocialism is only the most grandiose of these disguises of the old world 
                    of hierarchy and alienated labor.” </p>

                    <p>As for student unionism, it is nothing but a parody of a farce, a pointless and
                    ridiculous imitation of a long degenerated labor unionism. </p>

                    <p>The theoretical and practical denunciation of Stalinism in all its forms must be the
                    basic banality of all future revolutionary organizations. It is clear that in France, for
                    example, where economic backwardness has delayed awareness of the crisis, the
                    revolutionary movement can be reborn only over the dead body of Stalinism. <em>

                    <p>This revolution must once and for all break with its own prehistory and derive all its
                    poetry from the future. Little groups of &#147;militants&#148; claiming to represent the
                    &#147;authentic Bolshevik heritage&#148; are voices from beyond the grave; in no way do
                    they herald the future. These relics from the great shipwreck of the &#147;revolution
                    betrayed&#148; invariably end up defending the USSR; this is their scandalous betrayal of
                    revolution. They can scarcely maintain their illusions outside the famous underdeveloped
                    countries, where they serve to reinforce theoretical underdevelopment.<a href="#N_16_">

                    From <em>Partisans</em> (organ of reconciled Stalino-Trotskyist currents) to all the
                    tendencies and semi-tendencies squabbling over the dead body of Trotsky within and outside
                    the Fourth International, the same revolutionary <em>ideology</em> reigns, with the same
                    theoretical and practical inability to grasp the problems of the modern world. Forty years
                    of counterrevolution separate them from the Revolution. Since this is not 1920, they can
                    only be wrong (and they were already wrong in 1920). </p>

                    <p>The dissolution of the &#147;ultraleftist&#148; <em>Socialisme ou Barbarie</em> group
                    after its division into two fractions &#151; &#147;Cardanist-modernist&#148; and
                    &#147;traditional Marxist&#148; (<em>Pouvoir Ouvrier</em>) &#151; is proof, if any were
                    needed, that there can be no revolution outside the modern, nor any modern thought outside
                    the reinvention of the revolutionary critique (<em>Internationale Situationniste</em> #9).
                    Any separation between these two aspects inevitably falls back either into the museum of
                    revolutionary prehistory or into the modernism of the system, i.e. into the dominant
                    counterrevolution: <em>Voix Ouvrière</em> or <em>Arguments</em>.</p>

                    <p>As for the various anarchist groups, they possess nothing beyond a pathetic faith in
                    the ideological label &#147;Anarchy&#148; in which they have pigeonholed themselves. The
                    pitiful <em>Le Monde Libertaire,</em> obviously edited by <em>students,</em> attains the
                    most incredible degree of confusion and stupidity. Since they tolerate each other, they
                    would <em>tolerate anything</em>.</p>

                    <p>The dominant social system, which flatters itself on its constant modernization, must
                    now be confronted with a worthy opponent: the equally modernized negation that it is
                    itself producing.<a href="#N_17_">

                    </a> Let the dead bury the dead. The
                    practical demystifications of the historical movement are exorcizing the phantoms that
                    haunted revolutionary consciousness; the revolution of everyday life is being confronted
                    with the immensity of its tasks. Revolution and the life it announces must both be
                    reinvented. If the revolutionary project remains fundamentally the same &#151; the
                    abolition of class society &#151; this is because the conditions giving rise to that
                    project have nowhere been radically transformed. But this project must be taken up again
                    with a new radicality and coherence, learning from the failure of previous
                    revolutionaries, so that its partial realization will not merely bring about a new
                    division of society. </p>

                    <p>Since the struggle between the system and the new proletariat can only be in terms of
                    the <em>totality,</em> the future revolutionary movement must abolish anything within
                    itself that tends to reproduce the alienation produced by the <em>commodity system</em>
                    &#151; i.e. the system dominated by commodified labor. It must be a living critique of that
                    system, a negation embodying all the elements necessary for its <em>supersession</em>. As
                    Lukács correctly showed, revolutionary
                    organization is this necessary mediation between theory and practice, between man and
                    history, between the mass of workers and the proletariat <em>constituted as a 
                        class</em>.
                    (Lukács&#146;s mistake was to believe that the Bolshevik Party fulfilled this role.)<sup>
                        <a href="#11.">T11</a>
                    </sup> If
                    they are to be realized in practice, &#147;theoretical&#148; tendencies and differences
                    must immediately be translated into organizational questions. Everything ultimately
                    depends on how the new revolutionary movement resolves the organization question; on
                    whether its organizational forms are consistent with its essential project: <em>the
                        international realization of the absolute power of workers councils</em> as prefigured in
                    the proletarian revolutions of this century. Such an organization must make a radical
                    critique of all the foundations of the society it combats: commodity production; <em>ideology</em>
                    in all its guises; the state; and the separations imposed by the state.</p>

                    <p>The rock on which the old revolutionary movement foundered was the separation of theory
                    and practice. Only the supreme moments of proletarian struggles overcame this split and
                    discovered their own <em>truth</em>. No organization has yet bridged this gap. <em>Ideology,</em>
                    no matter how &#147;revolutionary&#148; it may be, always serves the rulers; it is the <em>alarm
                        signal</em> revealing the presence of the enemy fifth column. This is why the critique of
                    ideology must in the final analysis be the central problem of revolutionary organization.
                    Lies are a product of the alienated world; they cannot appear within an organization
                    claiming to bear the <em>social truth</em> without that organization thereby becoming one
                    more lie in a world of lies. </p>

                    <p>All the positive aspects of the power of workers councils must already be embryonically
                    present in any revolutionary organization aiming at their realization. Such an
                    organization must wage a mortal struggle against the Leninist theory of organization. The
                    1905 revolution and the Russian workers&#146; spontaneous self-organization into soviets
                    was already a critique in acts<a href="#N_18_">
                        <sup>(18)</sup>
                    </a> of that baneful theory.
                    But the Bolshevik movement persisted in believing that working-class spontaneity could not
                    go beyond &#147;trade-union consciousness&#148; and was thus incapable of grasping
                    &#147;the totality.&#148; This amounted to decapitating the proletariat so that the Party
                    could put itself at the &#147;head&#148; of the revolution. Contesting the
                    proletariat&#146;s historical capacity to liberate itself, as Lenin did so ruthlessly,
                    means contesting its capacity to totally run the future society. In such a perspective,
                    the slogan &#147;All power to the soviets&#148; meant nothing more than the conquest of
                    the soviets by the Party and the installation of the party state in place of the
                    withering-away &#147;state&#148; of the armed proletariat. </p>

                    <p>&#147;All power to the soviets&#148; must once again be our slogan, but literally this
                    time, without the Bolshevik ulterior motives. The proletariat can play the <em>game</em>
                    of revolution only if the stakes are the <em>whole world;</em> otherwise it is nothing.
                    The sole form of its power, <em>generalized self-management,</em> cannot be shared with
                    any other power. Because it represents the actual dissolution of all powers, it can
                    tolerate no limitation (geographical or otherwise); any compromises it accepts are
                    immediately transformed into concessions, into surrender. &#147;Self-management must be
                    both the means and the end of the present struggle. It is not only what is at stake in the
                    struggle, but also its adequate form. It is itself the material it works on, and its own
                    presupposition&#148; (&#147;The Class Struggles in Algeria&#148;). </p>

                    <p>A unitary critique of the world is the guarantee of the coherence and truth of a
                    revolutionary organization. To tolerate the existence of an oppressive system in some
                    particular region (because it presents itself as &#147;revolutionary,&#148; for example)
                    amounts to recognizing the legitimacy of oppression. To tolerate alienation in any one
                    domain of social life amounts to admitting an inevitability of all forms of reification.
                    It is not enough to be for the power of workers councils in the abstract; it is necessary
                    to demonstrate what it means concretely: the suppression of commodity production and
                    therefore of the proletariat. Despite their superficial disparities, all existing
                    societies are governed by the <em>logic of the commodity;</em> it is the basis of their
                    totalitarian self-regulation. Commodity reification is the <em>essential</em> obstacle to
                    total emancipation, to the free construction of life. In the world of commodity
                    production, praxis is not pursued in accordance with autonomously determined aims, but in
                    accordance with the directives of external forces. Economic laws take on the appearance of
                    natural laws; but their power depends <em>solely</em> on the &#147;unawareness of those
                    who participate in them.&#148; </p>

                    <p>The essence of commodity production is the loss of self in the chaotic and unconscious
                    creation of a world totally beyond the control of its creators. In contrast, the radically
                    revolutionary core of generalized self-management is everyone&#146;s conscious control
                    over the whole of life. The self-management of commodity alienation would only make
                    everyone the programmers of their own survival &#151; squaring the capitalist circle. The
                    task of the workers councils will thus be not the self-management of the existing world,
                    but its unceasing qualitative transformation: the concrete supersession of the commodity
                    (that enormous detour in the history of human self-production). </p>

                    <p>This supersession naturally implies the abolition of <em>work</em> and its replacement
                    by a new type of free activity, thereby eliminating one of the fundamental splits of
                    modern society: that between an increasingly reified labor and a passively consumed
                    leisure. Presently decomposing groups like <em>Socialisme ou Barbarie</em> or <em>Pouvoir

                    </a> although adhering to the modern
                    watchword of Workers&#146; Power, continue to follow the path of the old workers movement
                    in envisioning a reformism of labor through its &#147;humanization.&#148; But work itself
                    must now be attacked. Far from being &#147;utopian,&#148; the abolition of work is the
                    first condition for the effective supersession of commodity society, for the elimination
                    within each person&#146;s life of the separation between &#147;free time&#148; and
                    &#147;work time&#148; &#151; those complementary sectors of alienated life &#151; that is
                    a continual expression of the commodity&#146;s internal contradiction between use-value
                    and exchange-value. Only when this opposition is overcome will people be able to make
                    their vital activity subject to their will and consciousness and see themselves in a world
                    that they themselves have created. The democracy of workers councils is the solution to
                    all the present separations. It makes impossible &#147;everything that exists outside
                    individuals.&#148; </p>

                    <p>The conscious domination of history by the people who make it &#151; that is 
                    what the whole
                    revolutionary project amounts to. Modern history, like all past history, is the product of social
                    praxis, the (unconscious) result of human activities. In the era of totalitarian
                    domination, capitalism has produced its own new religion: the <em>spectacle</em>. The
                    spectacle is the terrestrial realization of <em>ideology</em>. Never has the world been so
                    inverted. &#147;And like the &#145;critique of religion&#146; in Marx&#146;s day, the
                    critique of the spectacle is today the essential precondition of any critique&#148; (<em>Internationale
                        Situationniste</em> #9). </p>

                    <p>Humanity is historically confronted with the problem of <em>revolution</em>. The
                    increasingly grandiose material and technological means are equalled only by the
                    increasingly profound dissatisfaction of everyone. The bourgeoisie and its Eastern heir,
                    the bureaucracy, are incapable of putting this overdevelopment (which will be the basis of
                    the <em>poetry</em> of the future) to any good use precisely because they both must strive
                    to <em>maintain an old order</em>. The most they can use it for is to reinforce their
                    police control. They can do nothing but accumulate <em>capital</em>, and therefore <em>proletarians</em>
                    &#151; a proletarian being someone who has no power over his life and who knows it. It is
                    the new proletariat&#146;s historical fortune to be the only consequent heir to the
                    valueless riches of the <em>bourgeois world</em> &#151; riches that it must transform and <em>supersede</em>
                    in such a way as to foster the development of fully realized human beings pursuing the
                    total appropriation of nature and of their own nature. This realization of human <em>nature</em>
                    can only mean the unlimited multiplication and full satisfaction of the real <em>desires</em>
                    which the spectacle represses into the darkest corners of the revolutionary unconscious,
                    and which it can realize only fantastically in the dreamlike delirium of its 
                    advertising.
                    The true fulfillment of genuine desires &#151; which means the abolition of all the
                    pseudoneeds and pseudodesires that the system manufactures daily in order to perpetuate
                    its own power &#151; cannot take place without the suppression and positive supersession
                    of the commodity spectacle. </p>

                    <p>Modern history can be liberated, and its innumerable achievements can be freely put to
                    use, only by the forces that it represses: the workers without power over the conditions,
                    the meaning and the products of their own activities. In the nineteenth century the
                    proletariat was already the heir of philosophy;<sup>
                        <a href="#12.">T12</a>
                    </sup> now it has become the heir of modern art
                    and of the first conscious critique of everyday life. It cannot suppress itself without at
                    the same time realizing art and philosophy. To transform the world and to change life are
                    one and the same thing for the proletariat,<sup>
                        <a href="#13.">T13</a>
                    </sup> the inseparable passwords to its suppression
                    as a class, the dissolution of the present reign of necessity, and the finally possible
                    accession to the reign of freedom. The radical critique and free reconstruction of all the
                    values and patterns of behavior imposed by alienated reality are its maximum program. Free
                    creativity in the construction of all moments and events of life is the only <em>poetry</em>
                    it can acknowledge, the poetry made by all, the beginning of the revolutionary festival.
                    Proletarian revolutions will be <em>festivals</em> or nothing, for festivity is the very
                    keynote of the life they announce. <em>Play</em> is the ultimate principle of this
                    festival, and the only rules it can recognize are to live without dead time and to enjoy
                    without restraints.<sup>

                    <a name="1.">T1.</a> In some passages of my translations from the SI I have 
                    followed the current practice of replacing formerly conventional masculine forms 
                    with gender-neutral ones (e.g. changing “man” to “humanity”). In other cases, 
                    however, I have retained the original terms in order to avoid a complicated 
                    recasting of what are sometimes already rather complex texts. In the present 
                    case, much of the incisiveness of the SI’s critique of “the student” would be 
                    lost if the text was changed to plural or “his or her” forms. <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note also that “student” in this pamphlet always refers 
                    to college students. Grade school and high school students are referred to by 
                    different French terms.</p>

                    <a name="8.">T8.</a> The SI&#146;s judgment of the Revolutionary Communist League
                    turned out to be mistaken in some respects. The RCL Zengakuren was not &#147;the&#148;
                    Zengakuren, but only one of several rival ones (another was dominated by the Japanese
                    Communist Party, others by various combinations of Trotskyists, Maoists, etc.). In the
                    early sixties the Zengakuren faction that was to form the RCL did indeed have many of the
                    positive features the SI attributed to it: it had a political platform distinctly to the
                    left of Trotskyism, participated militantly in political struggles on many fronts, and
                    seems to have had a fairly experimental approach to organizational and tactical questions.
                    In 1963 it sent some delegates to Europe who met the situationists, and it later
                    translated a few situationist texts into Japanese. At least by 1970, however, when an SI
                    delegate (Ren<font face="Times New Roman">é Viénet) </font>visited Japan, the RCL had devolved into a largely Leninist position and turned
                    out to be not very different from leftist sects everywhere else.</p>

                    <em> Karl Liebknecht:</em> one of the few German socialists to
                    oppose World War I. He and Rosa Luxemburg founded the Spartakus League in 1916; they were
                    both killed following the crushing of the Spartakist insurrection in January 1919.</p>

                    <p>
                    <a name="10.">T10.</a> The original text cites the Latin phrase <i>delenda 
                        Carthago</i> (“Carthage must be destroyed”) with which the ancient Roman senator 
                    Cato the Elder ended all his speeches. The sense is that the destruction of 
                    Stalinism must be constantly, and even obsessively, insisted upon until it is carried out.</p>
